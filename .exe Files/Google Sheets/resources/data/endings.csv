0,"Congratulations for staying undetected, [player]! With the amount of effort you've put 
into learning computer science in your spare time and keeping a good relationship 
with students and staff, someone with connections to Mark Zuckerberg referred you 
for a job at Facebook Inc. You were worried about your job application because it's 
very obvious you have no prior experience with computer science or even teaching, 
but when you went for the interview, they surprised you, and you still remember what 
they said to you:

""If you didn't know already, we collect information about everyone who uses our 
services. We already knew you had no experience, but the dedication you took 
to avoid being found is admirable, and we need people like you who can lie even in 
pressure of being prosecuted.""

You took the job, and now live a relatively stress-free life. 

We wish you good luck! (Please don't look through our financial records)"
1,"Congratulations [player]! You managed to avoid getting fired. Because of your 
reputation with the other staff and students, the university decided to promote you 
when someone in a higher position decided to retire. You decided to learn computer 
science through an online school (with a fake name, of course), so now you're not 
completely clueless about what you're supposed to teach! 

You've received lots of job offers from other universities and companies, 
but decided to stay here at Cardiff so no one questions your qualifications and 
work experience.

Good luck staying undetected for the rest of your career, [player]!"
2,"Congratulations [player]! You have managed to finish the year without getting fired! 
You've earned a considerable amount of money, and your partner isn't so mad 
about you pretending to be a professor anymore. 

You managed to stay under the radar, but you feel like faking your expertise 
is extremely stressful. After another month working as a professor, you decided
to quit the job and invest your money in your friend's pyramid scheme as an 
equal shareholder. Time to see what the future holds!"
3,"Congratulations [player]! You have managed to finish the year without getting fired. 
However, one of the members of staff got suspicious of your behaviour and inability
to help explain anything. They looked through your resume and discovered that you 
have no teaching experience. You haven't even worked for years!

The university decided to report you to the police for fraud, even though it really was 
their fault for hiring you in the first place. Now you're sitting in a jail cell waiting for 
your sentence. Your lawyers aren't hopeful. At least your cellmate isn't too bad for 
company. They do spend too much time staring at themselves in the mirror with their 
eyes wide open though, what a weirdo.

We wish you success with your time in prison, with good behaviour you'll probably
be out in a year!"
4,"Oh [player], what have you done.

Somehow you managed to get all the staff and students to hate you. It's no surprise 
that they found out you were a fraud. The janitor who was supposed to get your job 
ratted you out. Some of the students reported you to the university board. 
Everyone you've met reported you.

Someone hated you enough to set fire to the computer science building and pinned 
all the evidence on you. About 5 people claimed to be a witness to you pouring petrol 
all over the staff room. So now you stand outside the building, watching your fake 
life burn away. Some police officers are dragging you away, muttering about 
arson and fraud charges.

Have fun with life in prison!"
