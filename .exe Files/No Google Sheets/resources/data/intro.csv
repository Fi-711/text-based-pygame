"Well, this is it. 

Your first day working at Cardiff University. 

You originally applied for a job as a janitor, but they must've mixed up
your application with someone else's, because you got hired as a
teacher in the CompSci department instead.

You have no idea what you're doing, but the pay is way better soâ€¦

Off you go! ","Your main task is to finish the year without being sussed out by
everyone, especially not the head of school! You will have to grade
students' work and interact with your colleagues without causing
suspicion.

You will be given biographies of each student and must grade each
student with a PASS or a FAIL. Read them carefully, otherwise you may
face trouble along the way for the wrong decision!

In this game, characteristics and attributes can contribute to 
the pass/fail ratio. So for instance, a student who is clever is more likely
to pass than a student who is a class clown.

First, a tutorial!","Jonathan isn't a very serious student. He has a tendency to
fall asleep during class and constantly disrupts them by playing
loud meme sound files when he isn't asleep. Most of the staff
in the department have had run ins with him and his antics
but are unable to do anything about it because he has connections with
many of the higher management of the university.",Wot the fok did ye just say to me m8? i dropped out of newcastle primary skool im the sickest bloke ull all ever meet & ive nicked ova 300 chocolate globbernaughts frum tha corner shop. im trained in street fitin and i'm the strongest foker in the entire newcastle gym. yer nothing to me but a cheeky lil bellend w/ a fit mum and fakebling
