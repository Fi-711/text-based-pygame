2,"Ah, how you crave a good cup of tea right now. You brought 
some chocolate digestives from home to go along with your 
after-lecture tea. You take the milk out from the fridge and you 
grab the teabag from your secret stash. As you were about to 
pour the hot water from the kettle into your Sports Direct mug

You panic and run. Your colleagues now think you're selfish for breaking the kettle and not saying anything, they also think you're weird for drinking tea that's obviously not prepared right.",-5,0,-20

""[player]! Thanks for capturing Muffet for me! I brought her to work with me because she seemed a bit ill but she disappeared from her terrarium whilst I was helping a student out.""

As you try to pretend like you're not scared out of your f***ing mind, you smile and assure your colleague that it was alright.","You slam the spider with your 'Coding for Dummies' book. This attracted the attention of many of your colleagues, and one of them looks extremely angry. 

""[player], you just killed Muffet! How could you, I've been taking care of her for 6 years now!""

You feel horrible about what you've done, and your colleague is now avoiding you whenever they notice you're in the office.","At least you don't have to deal with that anymore, but why was there a huge spider just walking around the office? That was weird.
