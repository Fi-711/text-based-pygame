""Hello [player], I hope your day's been well. I know mine certainly hasn't been! I've been receiving so many angry emails from students and staff about your incompetency at simply even grading work! Are you sure you're ready for this job? Your CV says you've had 8 years of experience teaching in the past, I don't know why you're so incompetent here!""
